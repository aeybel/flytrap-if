<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Chapter 3 -- Help</span></p><p class="indent0">Abouting is an action out of world. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">about</span>&quot; as abouting. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">info</span>&quot; as abouting.</p><p class="indent0">Report abouting:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Welcome, friends, foes, and all else who happen upon this game. If you haven't already noticed, this game is a simple, light-hearted game about flytraps. Giant man-eating flytraps to be specific. It is intended to be a brief demo game of the interactive fiction medium, and contains one main puzzle. For more information about interactive fiction, type COMMANDS at the '&gt;' prompt.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Commanding is an action out of world. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">commands</span>&quot; as commanding.</p><p class="indent0">Report commanding:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">This is a work of interactive fiction. As such, there are a few things to note about how to interact with and play interactive fiction. As you have likely done already, the '&gt;' below is a prompt, in which you may type commands that will interact with the game world. Here is a fairly comprehensive list of commands that you will need to complete this game.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Directional commands are used for moving around. These commands include all of the cardinal directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST), and UP and DOWN, all of which can be abbreviated to their first letters (N, S, E, W, U, D). Other works of interactive fiction may use IN and OUT, and more specific directions such as NORTHWEST and SOUTHEAST, but these are not required for this game.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Two very important commands in interactive fiction are LOOK and EXAMINE. LOOK (or L) will give you a description of your location. EXAMINE (or X) [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">] will give you a description of something specified -- an item, a person, yourself, etc.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Conversation with other characters is through an ASK/TELL system. That means you can use ASK [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]someone[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">] ABOUT [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">]. There is no difference between ask and tell in this game. You can also GIVE [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">] TO [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]someone[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">].[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Other commands may work as well. A few examples are OPEN/CLOSE [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">], EAT [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">], ATTACK [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">], and PUT [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">] INTO [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]something[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">]. There are more verbs, but I cannot list them all here. There is no harm in experimenting, and many verbs may work. If you are trying to do something and it does not work, try a synonym. Good luck.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">Asking for help is an action out of world.
