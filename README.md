## What is Interactive Fiction?
Interactive Fiction (IF), also known as Text Adventures are a type of game in which players interact with the world through text commands. These are some of the oldest types of computer games and are known as being one of the most accessible types of games, as they can be easily read using a screen reader and only require simple text input. Check out some other games written using Inform 7 (not written by me): [Bronze](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=9p8kh3im2j9h2881) and [Colour The Truth](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=a746d3agtfizlx0x).
